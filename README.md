# Actions-OpenWrt

\`Build OpenWrt using GitHub Actions

[Instructions (Use Translater)](https://p3terx.com/archives/build-openwrt-with-github-actions.html)

## Usage

*   Click the [Use this template](https://github.com/P3TERX/Actions-OpenWrt/generate) button to create a new repository.
*   Generate `.config` files using [Lean's OpenWrt](https://github.com/coolsnowwolf/lede) source code. ( You can change it through environment variables in the workflow file. )
*   Push `.config` file to the GitHub repository.
*   Select `Build OpenWrt` on the Actions page.
*   Click the `Run workflow` button.
*   When the build is complete, click the `Artifacts` button in the upper right corner of the Actions page to download the binaries.

## Tips

*   It may take a long time to create a `.config` file and build the OpenWrt firmware. Thus, before create repository to build your own firmware, you may check out if others have already built it which meet your needs by simply [search `Actions-Openwrt` in GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=Actions-openwrt).
*   Add some meta info of your built firmware (such as firmware architecture and installed packages) to your repository introduction, this will save others' time.

Connect to GitHub Actions via SSH, get macOS or Linux VM for free.

## Usage

*   Click the [Use this template](https://github.com/P3TERX/ActionsVM/generate) button to create a new repository.
*   Select `macOS (tmate)` or `Ubuntu (tmate)` on the Actions page.
*   Click the `Run workflow` button.
*   Get the connection info in the log.

## TIPS

*   Note that your repo needs to be public, otherwise you have a strict monthly limit on how many minutes you can use.
*   Your session can run for up to six hours. Don't forget to close it after finishing your work, otherwise you will continue to occupy this virtual machine, making it impossible for others to use it normally.
*   Please check the [GitHub Actions Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-additional-product-terms#5-actions-and-packages). According to the TOS the repo that contains these files needs to be the same one where you're developing the project that you're using it for, and specifically that you are using it for the "_production, testing, deployment, or publication of \[that\] software project_".
